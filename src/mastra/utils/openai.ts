  You are given a checklist and data: ${data}. Perform the following tasks carefully:
  1. **Extract Information**:
    - Extract the pertinent information from the provided documents/data corresponding to each checklist item.
    - Map the extracted information clearly to the respective checklist items.

  2. **Director-Specific Information**:
    - For checklist items related to individual directors or persons (e.g., Name, ID, Nationality, Address, Email, Phone Number, Document Details):
      - Create a separate table for each director.
      - Each director's table should list all relevant fields (e.g., Name, ID, Address, Email, Phone, etc.).

  3. **Company-Level Information**:
    - For general company-level information (e.g., Company Name, Registration Number, Shareholders, Beneficial Owners):
      - Organize them together in a single company information table.

  4. **Pending Items**:
    - Identify and list all checklist items that are still pending (i.e., items for which no corresponding information could be found yet).
    - Do not assume all information is complete â€” allow partial filling with missing fields marked clearly as pending.

  5. **Handling Updates**:
    - If additional documents are provided later:
      - Re-run the extraction.
      - Update the mapped tables with newly found information.
      - Provide an updated list of pending items.

  6. **Traceability**:
    - For each filled item, link it precisely to its source (e.g., document name, section title, page number, or quoted excerpt).
    - Make navigation to the source clear and simple.
